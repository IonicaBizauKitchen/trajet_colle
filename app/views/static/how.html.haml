    Trajet Coll√© is an anonymous and freely editable system. 
    There is no signup process. Any person can build maps or add to existing ones.
    To create your own map, follow these instructions..
    
  %h2 1. Create a Map at trajetcolle.com
  %p
    Before you go out and start marking spots, you'll first want to create a map on the site. 
    That way you know someone hasn't already used the map name you have in mind. 
    = link_to("Click here to create a map.", new_map_path)

  %h2 2. Print some Imagery    
  %p
    Print out a bunch of copies of the 
    = link_to("bicycle image", "/downloads/trajet_colle_velo.pdf")
    or better yet, create your own imagery. Get yourself some tape, spray adhesive, or a 
    = link_to("wheatpasting setup.", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatpaste")
    
  %h2 3. Hit the Streets
  %p
    Carry copies of your imagery when you're out on the town. Keep some in your backpack, your trunk, etc.
    When you find a spot where you want to post one of your images,
    think of a good name for the spot, and write the URL-to-be of your spot 
    <strong>on the image itself</strong> in this format: 
    <strong>trajetcolle.com/<em>yourmapname</em>/<em>yourspotname</em></strong>. 
    Here are some example URLs..
    
  %ul
    %li http://trajetcolle.com/mymap/supercoolspot
    %li http://trajetcolle.com/downtown/payphone45
    %li http://trajetcolle.com/swimmingholes/beavercreek
    
  %p Once you've got the URL written on your image, stick it on the wall!

  %h2 4. Document the Spot with a Photo
  %p
    Take a photo of the spot (you've got a camera-phone, right?), then upload or email the image to your
    Flickr account (you've got one of those too, right?). If you've got an iPhone, your best option is the
    = link_to("Flickup app", "http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284953492&mt=8")
    , which automatically geotags your photos and uploads them right to your Flickr account. If you don't have 
    an iPhone but can email images with your phone, find out what your
    = link_to("Flickr uploader email address", "http://www.flickr.com/account/uploadbyemail/")
    is and upload the photo that way.
    
  %h2 5. Geotag your Image
  %p
    If you don't use Flickup (or some other fancy-pants application), you'll need to <em>geotag</em>
    your image after uploading it. Go the photo's page on Flickr and click the 'Add to Your Map' link in the bottom right. 
    This will present you with a map and a crosshair, so you can mark your image's exact latitude/longitude.
    
  %h2 6. Add your Spot(s) to your Map
  %p
    Come back to trajetcolle.com, click on the map you created, and click 'Add a Spot'. 
    To add a new spot to your map, you simply paste in the Flickr Photo URL, and trajetcolle.com
    will automatically gather the title, description, and location from the photo data on flickr.
